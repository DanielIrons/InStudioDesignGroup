					<p>Why do I need an interior designer?</p>
				</div>

Working with an Interior Designer will help you to move seamlessly and efficiently through the project, as well as help you prevent costly mistakes or side-steps along the way.

				<div class="Q">
					<p>Is a budget necessary?</p>
				</div>
				<div class="A">
					<p>Absolutely, the budget is essential for planning and designing your space without time costly revisions. This saves time and we can get you into your finished room as quickly as possible. The budget is the difference between designing (for example) a $150,000 kitchen and a $15,000 kitchen which goes without saying is quite an enormous difference.</p>

				<div class="Q">
					<p>What should I have at our first meeting?</p>
				</div>
				<div class="A">
					<ul>

						<li>formal or casual, traditional or contemporary?</li>

			<div class="question">
				<div class="Q">
					<p>Why do you have a design fee and purchasing fee on the product?</p>
				</div>
				<div class="A">
					<p>
						The design fee is for design concepts, solutions to the problems, and advice on any purchases. When a product is ordered through the designer, there is a great deal of time spent on producing purchase orders, ordering cuttings of fabrics, and wall-coverings from current stock for approval. Our procurement fee is 25-30% plus the cost of goods sold. As professionals we have access to wholesale vendors from whom we have built a relationship with over time to ensure over quality control of your purchased items before they arrive to you. Additionally, time is spent on coordinating deliveries and generally ensuring that the whole process runs smoothly until the item is delivered to the client. The purchasing fee covers this entire process and assures the clients&apos; peace of mind. In addition, to having insider accesses to products you still save with designer discount and are typically not subject to full retail costs.
